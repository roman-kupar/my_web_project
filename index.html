        <h3>What is chess?</h3>
        <p>Chess is a board game between two players. It is sometimes called Western chess or international chess to distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). 
          The current form of the game emerged in Spain and the rest of Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga, a similar but much older game of Indian origin.
          Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide.
          Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. 
          The player controlling the white pieces moves first, followed by the player controlling the black pieces. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. 
          There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.

      <h3>How to start a game?</h3>
      <p>A chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game (the "opening moves"). Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defense.
         They are catalogued in reference works such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. There are dozens of different openings, varying widely in character from quiet positional play (for example, the Réti Opening) to very aggressive (the Latvian Gambit). 
         In some opening lines, the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves.
         Professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers, as opening theory continues to evolve.
      </p>
      <p>The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar:

        development: This is the technique of placing the pieces (particularly bishops and knights) on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game.
        control of the center: Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent.
        king safety: It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities. A correctly timed castling can often enhance this.
        pawn structure: Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns, and pawn islands – and to force such weaknesses in the opponent's position</p>
      <h3>There are dozens of different combination. So, every game is unique</h3>

      <p>For sure. There are dozens of different combination and every game is unique.  The World Chess Championship is played to determine the world champion in chess. 
        The current world champion is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a> of Norway, who has held the title since 2013.Carlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. He retained his title against Anand the following year and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz Championship, becoming the first player to hold all three titles simultaneously, a feat which he repeated in 2019. He defended his classical world title against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, against Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and against Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021. Carlsen will not defend his title against Nepomniachtchi in 2023.
